# Instructions for Adding Demo Video to README

Your demo video has been moved to: `screenshots/demo_video.mp4`

## How to Add Video to GitHub README:

### Option 1: Upload to GitHub Releases (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Upload `screenshots/demo_video.mp4`
4. Copy the asset URL
5. Replace this line in README.md:
   ```
   https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/demo_video.mp4
   ```
   With your actual video URL

### Option 2: Use GitHub Issues (Quick Method)
1. Go to any issue in your repo (or create a dummy one)
2. Drag and drop `screenshots/demo_video.mp4` into the comment box
3. GitHub will upload it and give you a URL
4. Copy that URL and paste it in README.md
5. Delete the dummy issue if you created one

### Option 3: Convert to GIF (Smaller Size)
If the video is too large:
1. Use an online converter: https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif
2. Upload your MP4
3. Download the GIF
4. Add to README like an image:
   ```markdown
   ![Demo](screenshots/demo.gif)
   ```
