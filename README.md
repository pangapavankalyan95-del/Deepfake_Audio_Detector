# Deepfake Audio Detection System
**Developed by: Panga Pavan Kalyan**

A deep learning system for detecting AI-generated (deepfake) audio using CNN+BiLSTM architecture with explainable AI features.

## Features

- **High Accuracy Detection**: Detects deepfake audio with 99%+ accuracy using CNN+BiLSTM.
- **Micro-Temporal Analysis**: Pinpoints exactly *when* the audio is fake (e.g., "Fake from 02:45 to 05:10").
- **Forensic Dashboard**: Professional "Cyber-Blue" UI with Spectrograms, Frequency Radar, and XAI Heatmaps.
- **3D Spectral Analysis**: Interactive 3D terrain exploration of audio frequencies (Zoom/Rotate).
- **Speaker Verification**: Enroll voice profiles to verify identity matching (Bio-metric + Deepfake Defense).
- **Multiple Input Methods**: 
    - 🎤 Live Recording
    - 📂 File Upload
    - 🧪 One-Click Test Samples (Real, Fake, and Mixed)
- **Mixed Audio & Splicing Detection**:
    - **Smart Verdicts**: Distinguishes between "Strict" (Live) and "Suspicious" (Files) to catch spliced audio.
    - **Segment Breakdown**: Lists exact timestamps: "Real: 0s-4s, Fake: 4s-5s".
    - **Splicing XAI**: Detects "Insertion Attacks" (e.g., adding words to a sentence).
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed PDF Forensic Reports with visualizations, **Temporal Analysis Tables**, and **Visual Timeline Diagrams**. Styling is dynamically optimized based on the verdict ("REAL", "FAKE", or "SUSPICIOUS").
- **Containerized Deployment**: Ready-to-use Docker environment for consistent, one-click deployment across any platform.
- **Neural Engine Diagnostics**: View live model architecture summaries and real-time performance metrics directly in the dashboard.


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10** (Required for TensorFlow 2.10 GPU compatibility).
- **CUDA 11.2 & cuDNN 8.1** (Recommended for GPU acceleration).
- **8GB+ RAM** (16GB recommended).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DeepfakeProject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Launch (Standard)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Launch (Docker - Recommended)
The fastest way to run the project without managing Python environments:
```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
Access the interface at `http://localhost:8501`.


**Quick Test Features**:
Navigate to the **TEST SAMPLE** tab to instantly load:
- ✅ **Random Real**: Valid human speech sample.
- ⚠️ **Random Fake**: Deepfake sample from ASVspoof.
- 🔄 **Random Mixed**: Complex sample containing both real and fake segments (for Temporal Analysis testing).

### Training a New Model

1. Prepare your dataset in the following structure:
```
data/dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── real/  # Real audio files (.wav, .mp3, .flac)
│   └── fake/  # Deepfake audio files
└── dev/       # Validation set (same structure)
```

2. Open and run `Deepfake_Detection_Complete.ipynb` in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook Deepfake_Detection_Complete.ipynb
```

The notebook handles:
- Data loading with memory-efficient generators
- Model training with early stopping (patience=3)
- Automatic model saving to `models/model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- Metrics and plot generation

## Performance Metrics

The app automatically displays metrics from the latest trained model:
- **Confusion Matrix**: True/False positives and negatives
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Generating Metrics for Saved Models

If you have a trained model without metrics:

```bash
python generate_presentation_plots.py
```

This will:
- Find the latest model in `models/`
- Evaluate on the validation set
- Generate confusion matrix and performance plots
- Save results in the model's folder

## Technical Details

### Audio Preprocessing

1. Load audio at 16kHz, 10-second duration (padded/trimmed)
2. Apply noise reduction (80% prop_decrease)
3. Extract mel spectrogram (128 mel bands)
4. Convert to dB scale and normalize to [0, 1]

### Memory Optimization

- **Data Generators**: Load audio on-the-fly in batches
- **Batch Size 16**: Optimized for 8GB VRAM
- **Timestamped Models**: Each training run saved separately

### Explainable AI

- **Grad-CAM**: Highlights frequency-time regions that influenced the decision
- **Region Analysis**: Identifies suspicious time ranges and frequency bands
- **Confidence-Based Explanations**: Contextual text based on prediction score

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Not Detected

Ensure CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1 are installed and in PATH:
```bash
python verify_gpu_final.py
```

### Out of Memory

- Reduce batch size to 8 in the notebook
- Close other applications
- Use CPU-only mode (slower but works)

### Model Not Loading in App

- Check that `models/model_*/model.keras` exists
- Verify the model was trained successfully
- Check console for error messages

### Input Shape Mismatch Error
If you see `ValueError: expected shape=...313... found ...157...`:
- The model now expects 10 seconds of audio.
- Ensure `app.py` has `target_width = 313` and `duration=10` in `load_audio`.
